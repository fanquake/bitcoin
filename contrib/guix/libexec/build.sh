# Although Guix _does_ set umask when building its own packages (in our case,
# this is all packages in manifest.scm), it does not set it for `guix
# shell`. It does make sense for at least `guix shell --container`
# to set umask, so if that change gets merged upstream and we bump the
# time-machine to a commit which includes the aforementioned change, we can
# remove this line.
#
# This line should be placed before any commands which creates files.
